# Airborne_Wind_Energy
Creating extraterrestrial habitats has been a goal for many years. Mars is a prime location due to its relative
habitability compared to other planets in the solar system. Yet it still poses many challenges for human habi
tation. The Rhizome project, being funded by the European Energy Agency, is to use a renewable energy
system as its form of power production. Airborne Wind Energy System on Mars (AWESOM) will address this
challenging problem presented the Rhizome project.

This report describes 10 weeks of work towards the conceptual design of a Martian based airborne wind energy
system coined AWESOM. AWESOM is capable of providing 10 kilowatts of nominal power to a Martian habitat
for 5 Martian years. This means that the system has to account for seasonal fluctuations and will make use
of a compressed carbon dioxide long term energy storage solution, that is capable of storing enough energy
during the months where power generation is plenty and transferring this energy to the habitat during the low
power production periods. This period has been identified to be somewhere in the months of Martian summer.
The basic idea of the system is that a wing is connected to a tether that is spooled onto a drum connected to
a generator. To produce power, this wing is flown up to 300 m in altitude and as a result the drum is rotated
when the tether reels out. This pulling force of the drum induces a torque on the motor and hence power is
generated. To reel in back the wing, the aerodynamics of the kite is altered to reduce the pulling force which
in turn results in a net surplus of power generated as less energy is needed to reel in the kite than the reeling
out. This process is known as the pumping cycle and multiple of them take place over the period of a day to
generate the required power for the habitat.

An extensive weather model was used, namely: the Mars Climate General Circulation Model. This allowed
for the wind profile within the location of the site to be studied and as a result a new location was selected
for improved wind conditions compared to the location chosen by last yearâ€™s DSE group. This climate model
was also incorporated into the performance model of the entire kite system, providing valuable insights into the
iterative process of selecting and sizing the system characteristics. The aerodynamics characteristics of the
system primarily consists of selecting the airfoil of the wing subsystem and optimizing the relevant parameters.
The Wortmann FX63137 was deemed to be the most aerodynamically suitable for this application and the wing
was sized with a 60 m2 surface area and a span of 20 m. Control of the wing is important to both the power
generation capability as well as the survivablility of the kite. The wing is to fly in a figure of eight trajectory. This
allows for the wing to exploit higher cross wind speeds and subsequently generate more power. The figure of
eight path also prevents the main tether from tangling with the control tethers.
<br/>
Another critical component of the system as a whole are the structural characteristics of the wing as it heavily
influences the weight of the kite and this has a knockon effect on the sizing of every other subsystem. A
structural model was developed to determine the size of the wingbox, canopy, ribs and truss members. For
each element, the failure modes were investigated and taken into account during the normal and worst case
scenario operations of the wing. As a result, the mass of the wing was determined to be 79.7 kg. The ground
station consists of the main power generating components which convert mechanical to electrical energy. It
was determined that a high torque, low speed, direct drive motor is ideal to avoid the use of a gearbox which
substantially increases the efficiency of the system as a whole. To fulfill the seasonal needs, a 70 kW motor was
chosen after considering all necessary efficiency loses. The main drum being were the main power generation
tether is spooled on has as size of 0.6 m diameter.
<br/>
To ensure that the entire operation of the system is as autonomous as possible, various takeoff and landing
methods were considered. After performing a tradeoff, a vertical mast and horizontal boom configuration was
chosen where the main tether and control tethers are fed through respectively. This entire system sits on
rotating platform which allows for the kite operation to be independent of wind direction as it can swivel in all
directions. Launching is assisted by rovers which have been decommissioned from the RHIZOME project and
modified to fit the launch tasks.
<br/>
A comprehensive risk assessment was done to ascertain the risks that the system might face during its entire
life cycle. Various risk mitigation strategies were identified to reduce the impact and likelihood of the most
critical ones.A RAMS analysis was also carried out and it was concluded that the system is able to comply
with most the requirements that were set forth. Through the financial analysis, it is determined that the total
production cost of the system is 22.8 % of the allocated cost budget. The return on investment is deduced to
be from educational means. This includes the education of the public on the importance of space exploration
as well as scientific breakthroughs that can both be incorporated into Earth based and space based energy
generating technologies.
